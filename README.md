# Tinylytics-for-Micro.blog

A Micro.blog plug-in to easily add Tinylytics tracking to your site.

## How To Use This Plug-in

If you haven't already, you'll need to sign up for a [Tinylytics.app](https://tinylytics.app) account and configure a site for the plug-in to work.

Once installed, in the plug-in settings, enter your unique site id from your [Tinylytics.app](https://tinylytics.app) site configuration as shown in this screenshot:

## Displaying Hits

If you want to display hits somewhere on your site (say, the footer), check the "Display hits?" checkbox. You'll have to modify your Micro.blog theme on your own to get hits to display. 
Checkout the Tinylytics "[Showing a hit counter](https://tinylytics.app/docs/show_hit_counter)" help article for an idea how this is accomplished.

## Displaying Kudos

If you want to display a Kudos counter on individual post pages, check the "Show Kudos?" checkbox. You'll have to modify your Micro.blog theme on your own to get hits to display as well. I recommend adding the following code somewhere on your single post page:

````
<button class="tinylytics_kudos"></button>
````

See the Tinylytics "[Showing kudos](https://tinylytics.app/docs/showing_kudos)" help article for more details.

In addition to a Kudos counter, you can set a label using any combination of emoji and/or text. If you don't set a label on your own, the default will show up as "ðŸ‘‹".

## Shortcodes

If you'd like to avoid making changes to your theme template files, you can use a shortcode embed instead.

To add a site counter to the footer of your site, simply edit your site's customer footer and add the following short code:

````
{{< tiny_hits >}}
````

An example would look something like this:

<img src="screenshots/tinyhits-example.png" alt="tinylytics hits shorcode" width="700" />

To add Kudos to individual posts, for example a long post with title, while leaving your short posts without Kudos, you can use a shortcode for that too:

````
{{< tiny_kudos >}}
````

An example would look something like this:

<img src="screenshots/tinykudos-example.png" alt="tinylytics kudos shorcode" width="700" />

## Tinylytics CSS Styles

Out of the box, Tinylytics works great without any styling applied, but if you'd like to tweak the styles to better match your site, here are the CSS classes:

````
.tinylytics_hits {
    /* styles the hit counter number only */
}

.tinylytics_kudos {
    /* this class styles the entire Kudos button * /
}

.did_select {
    /* styles the Kudos button to appear differnt once a Kudo is given */
}
````
