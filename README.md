# Tinylytics-for-Micro.blog

A Micro.blog plugin to easily add Tinylytics tracking.

## How To Use

In the plug-in settings, enter your site id from your [Tinylytics.app](https://tinylytics.app) site configuration.

If you want to display hits somewhere on your site, check the "Display hits?" checkbox. You'll have to modify your Micro.blog theme on your own to get hits to show. See this Tinylytics [help article](https://tinylytics.app/docs/show_hit_counter) for a good explanation how to accomplish this.

If you have questions or find a bug, hit me up on Micro.blog at [@jimmitchell](https://micro.blog/jimmitchell).
